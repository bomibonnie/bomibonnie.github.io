      <title>Climate Bones of Contention</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Sara McLaughlin Mitchell&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cody J. Schmidt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict scholars examine the relationship between climate variability and conflict onset, with an emphasis on connections between precipitation and temperature shifts/shocks and intrastate violence. While empirical findings in this literature are mixed, we know less about how climate changes increase the risks for interstate conflicts between countries. This paper studies climate variability using the issue approach to world politics, connecting deviations and volatility in temperature and precipitation to the onset and militarization of diplomatic conflicts involving territorial, maritime, and river areas. We argue that climate variability increases interstate conflict risks by intensifying the salience and uncertainty of contested geopolitical areas. Analyses of issue claims in the Western Hemisphere and Europe (1901-2001) show that greater deviations and volatility in climate conditions increases risks for new diplomatic conflicts and militarization of ongoing issues and that chances for issue conflict are greatest for revisionist states (challengers). We confirm prior results that identify volatility in climate conditions as potentially dangerous steps to war.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Triangles in Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do triangular relationships influence international relations? When focusing on a rivalry in cross-networks of positive and negative relationships, one can be embedded in three types of triangles. Type Ⅰ consists of one rivalry and two positive relationships, Type Ⅱ of two rivalries and one positive relationship, and Type Ⅲ of three rivalries.  Based on Heider’s (1946) balance theory, Type Ⅱ triangle is balanced, thus, it is more likely to maintain while Type Ⅰ and Ⅲ are less likely because they are imbalanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, In Type Ⅰ triangle, a rivalry is connected to a shared friend, thus, the friend of my enemy is my friend. When two rivals have a common friend, we can expect that the third party can be a potential mediator. For instance, when the tension between South Kore and Japan escalated over the disputed territory, the US tried to mediate their conflict because both South Korea and Japan are US’ alliance partners. Second, Type Ⅱ triangle can be more maintainable since the third party is one’s friend as well as the other’s enemy. In other words, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Type Ⅱ is consistent with extended deterrence. When two friends have a common enemy, their friendship can be stronger and their rivalries can maintain longer. Lastly, in Type Ⅲ triangle, the enemy of my enemy is also my enemy. Under this situation, all countries have a common enemy, thus, if the severity levels are not equal, then one of the three rivalries can be weaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, I examine whether and how various triangular relationships affect interstate relationships particularly rivalry duration. Network analysis is employed to capture the various triangles. Preliminary analyses of rivalry duration show that rivalries are more likely to terminate when they have a common friend and particularly, the friend is a major power.&lt;/p&gt;
